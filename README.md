# Weighted-Stryktipsrandomizers
The Swedish Stryktipset started the 20 October 1934. Since 1934 they haven't changed the betting game at all. But now we have a weighted randomizer to the game. To get started just opened the python file and then you should get a row.
The row should look something like this:
```
  1  -   | |2
  2  -  1| |
  3  -   | |2
  4  -   |X|
  5  -   |X|
  6  -  1| |
  7  -   | |2
  8  -   |X|
  9  -  1| |
  10 -   |X|
  11 -  1| |
  12 -  1| |
  13 -  1| |
```
# How to use
To get started.
Run the stryktips.py file in python2.7 and you will directly recive a generated row.
